# `faust2api_a` Documentation

**NOTE:** this documentation was taken from the `faust2api_a` README.

## Overview
 
This is an ongoing project and for now, "faust2api_a" is modified by Allen for "faust2smartphone". It keeps almost all the funtions of "faust2api" for iOS and Android.

## Using `faust2api_a`

The various options of `faust2api` can be displayed at any point by running:

	faust2api_a -help

`faust2api_a` is part of the [Faust distribution](https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust). To use it, Faust must be properly installed on your system (read the Faust README in the previous link to get more information on how to do that).

### Android Support

To turn a Faust code into an Android API, just run the following command:

	faust2api_a -android yourFaustCode.dsp

    faust2api_a -androidmotion yourFaustCode.dsp (for motion.lib support)

    faust2api_a -androidplugin yourFaustCode.dsp (for Faust plugin)

    faust2api_a -iosmotion yourFaustCode.dsp (for motion.lib support)

### Customizing the API

    -osc add OSC support to the api.
